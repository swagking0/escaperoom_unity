# escaperoom_unity



this is the first live implementation of my skill set which i gained as part virtual reality course. In this

there are two phases of devlopment involved to achieve the final product:
--first phase is to develop the 3D models of the escape in room using blender 3D 
--Secound phase is to develop the working of this developed 3D model to eperience the VR in real time. This is achived using Unity 3D

The working of it has both simple and complexity situations...which makes the escape room intersting to play on

Note: the model only works with full setup virtual reality environment.
