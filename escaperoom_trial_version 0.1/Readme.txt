Virtual Reality [Escape room] Unity working model explanation
----------------------------------------------------------------

AIM: The main moto is to establish escape room based learning platform.
     Where one can learn things in fun way.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
As mentioned above in the aim that trying to bulid a fun
to learn things using escape room as base. For which I designed my model
where chemistry can me learn in fun way by sloving few questions and escape
the room. In this process the blender modelling was achieved and now the 
real time wokring escape room using unity to made it come alive. the woring 
is explained below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKING OF ESCAPE ROOM:

For working of the model in unity and experience the virtual effect STEAM VR
plugin is used with this for having the hands on the room required standered
VR setup is needed with this all in place play the room.

As soon as you play room first as a player observe your surroundings and see 
what is available. With a sample sketch of the room in your mind, Now follow
this steps to escape the room:

1. As you see on the "Black Board" there are 3 Questions which are needed to
be sloved and understand by you. To slove each question there are different 
clues available in the room as part escape room.

* Clues:
  1.A. For the 1st question answer is on the one of the "Wall of the room". If
       you could not find it, The answer is : 2CO.
  1.B. For the 2nd question answer is on the "Notice Board". If you could not
       find it, The answer is: 8.
  1.C. For the 3rd question answer is in the "Experiment Table" in the form of 
       book. If you could not find it, Ther answer is: NaCl.

2. After finding clues and sloving the questions it's now time to escape the
   room for that you need a "Key" to open the main door.

3. As, mentioned above the clue for 3rd question is used to open the 
   "Locker" which contains the key therefore follow this steps to escape:
     
     -Experiment table has one door movable in one direction. 
      Open it using the controllers and grab the book in it using controller.
     -The book which is grabed is used to open the locker. So, carry the book
      near to the locker and the locker open animation is played.
     -Leave the book and now grab the key present in the locker.
     -Carry the key to the escape door or main door of the escape room. You
      could see the door open as Door open animation is played.

4. With this please go through the "NOTE" mentioned below for more technical
   details.

5. With following all this steps you can escape the room and congratulations
   for learning chemistry and escaping the room.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 
* The button of controllers which is used is "GRIP".
* And after grabing any object using the grip button of the controller. You
  again need to press the grip button on the controller to leave the object.
* But in case of Experiment table door you just need to grab the door and it
  is set automatical to leave as the grip button on the controller is left
  after grabing it. But for all other objects you need to press the grip
  button of the controller again to leave the object.
* As it is a escape room all objects which can transform with controller when
  grabed are made to fly away from the room once left. So, play carefully.
* Animations are played automatically when the respective tag object is 
  brought near to the trigger colliders.
